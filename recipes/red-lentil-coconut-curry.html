        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon each: cumin seeds and coriander seeds</li>
            <li>1 head garlic, chopped (10-12 cloves)</li>
            <li>28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ginger, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon turmeric</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
            <li>1 cup dried red lentils</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons cayenne powder, optional</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>15 ounce can coconut milk</li>
            <li>A few handfuls of cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the coconut oil in a large pot or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the cumin and coriander seeds and toast until they start to brown, about 45 seconds. Add the garlic to the pot and let it brown, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the can of crushed tomatoes, ginger, turmeric, and sea salt to the pot and cook, stirring the pot a few times, for 5 minutes. Add the lentils and, if using, the cayenne powder, and the water to the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until the lentils are soft. Stir the pot a few times to prevent the lentils from sticking to the bottom. If the curry starts to look dry, add an extra ½ – 1 cup of water.</li>
            <li>Once the lentils are soft and the curry is thick, add the coconut milk and cherry tomatoes and bring the pot back to a simmer. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
