        <p>“Bringing together two big hitters – aubergine and lasagne – this recipe is guaranteed to make you smile. It’s cheesy, oozy and mega delicious, plus it’s really fun to make. First I steam the aubergine, to make it soft, silky and a total pleasure to eat, then I crisp it up with garlic, chilli, sage and lemon for added flavour, before turning it into the most scrumptious sauce. Enjoy! ”</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 x 400 g aubergines</li>
            <li>3 onions</li>
            <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 bunch of fresh sage , (30g)</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried chilli flakes</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>2 x 400 g tins of quality plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>80 g mature Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>80 g Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>300 g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>50 g blanched almonds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large shallow casserole pan on a medium heat with 250ml of water.</li>
            <li>Prick the whole aubergines all over with a fork, halve lengthways and place in the pan. Peel, quarter and add the onions, then cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic, and pick the sage leaves.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid, and once most of the liquid has cooked away, make a well in the middle. Add 3 tablespoons of oil, the garlic, chilli flakes and most of the sage leaves, then finely grate in the lemon zest. Once golden, scrunch in the tomatoes, pour in 2 tins' worth of water, and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat, grate in the cheeses, then season to absolute perfection with sea salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Tear in the pasta sheets and mix up really well to coat and separate, then pull some of the sheets to the top to create a top layer.</li>
            <li>Bash the almonds until fine and rub the remaining sage leaves with oil, then sprinkle on top.</li>
            <li>Use the back of a spoon to create some dips and wells, and bake for 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. I love this served with a big crunchy green salad dressed with balsamic vinegar.</li>
